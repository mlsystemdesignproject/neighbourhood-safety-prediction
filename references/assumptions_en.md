# Assumptions:

### Pickpocketing:  
The frequency of those incidents could be influenced by the presence of tourists, including popular attractions, shops, and other points of interest in the Borough. [check 2. Tourist Season]

### Bike Theft: 
The frequency of this type of crime might be linked to the number of offices in a district and the availability of secure bike storage facilities (beyond just using bike locks).

### Vandalism Incidents: 
The frequency of those incidents might be correlated with socioeconomic factors and a high concentration of nightlife in the area.

### Residential Robberies: 
The occurrence of home robberies could be connected to neighborhood socioeconomic status, residential density, home security measures, access points (proximity to main roads or escape routes), surveillance presence (CCTV, neighborhood watch), proximity to police stations, and visibility (poor lighting, overgrown vegetation).

### Drug-Related Crimes:
The occurrence of drug-related crimes might be influenced by the proximity of known drug trafficking routes, areas with a high concentration of nightlife, and locations where drug use is prevalent.

### Gang Activity: 
Certain types of crimes, such as gang-related incidents, could be influenced by the presence of specific neighbourhoods with a history of gang activity, as well as socioeconomic factors.

### Domestic Violence: 
Incidents of domestic violence might be affected by factors like population density, age distribution, and economic stressors.

### Hate Crimes:
Hate crimes could be influenced by demographic factors like ethnic diversity, religious institutions, and local political tensions.

## Need to consider:

### 1. Public Events
The occurrence of crimes might vary during major public events, such as festivals, sports games, or political rallies, due to increased crowd sizes and potential disruption.

### 2. Tourist Season
Apart from petty theft, other types of crimes could vary with the tourist season. Crimes like scams and tourist-targeted thefts might be more common when tourist numbers are high.

### 3. Proximity to Police Stations
Crimes may be influenced by the proximity of police stations. Areas closer to police facilities might experience lower crime rates due to the off-putting effect.

### 4. Economic Factors
Crime rates could be influenced by economic factors, such as unemployment rates and poverty levels, which might lead to increased desperation.

### 5. Community Engagement
Areas with strong community engagement and neighbourhood watch programs might experience reduced crime rates.
